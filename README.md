# FixieSpec

Not much to see here yet.

This is a personal project for now to try out my best of breed development stack (personal opinion).

So you might wonder what I consider a good devlopment stack:
Things should be easly and low friction.

To test thigs out I decided to create a small specification framework.
As you might be aware there 2 types of specification frameworks.

The ones intended to be used by developers and the ones targeting at non developers.
This one will be for devlopers.

You might ask: Why create a new specification framework?
There so many good ones already. And you would be right.
As mentioned already I am crearting it to learn something new.
There is a lot to learn. Things change fast. A good approauch from 2 years ago becomes outdated very quickly.

This is the stack I am working with:
