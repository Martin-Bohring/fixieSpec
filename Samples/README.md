# About the Sample #
This is a different sample then you are used to.

## Why Audio Video ##
I am sick of all the bank account and calculator samples.
Therefore I was looking for something different that still allows to test drive fixieSpec.

Think about your Smartphone. What can it do for you. A lot it seems:

- Taking and making phone calls (really, I did'nt know my phone can do that)
- Taking and making video calls using different apps
- Taking pictures
- Recording videos
- Voice recording
- Playing music
- Playing recorded or downloaded videos
- Playing recorded voice
- All of that using the headset or the speaker and a microphone.

## What is specified using fixieSpec ##
All of those uses cases above are competing for the same resources like:

- Speaker
- Microphone
- Camera

So everybody knows the domain and it is complex enough to serve as an example, but not too complex.
